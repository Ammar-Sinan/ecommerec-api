# ecommerec-api

ecommerce web application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with the Mongoose ORM. 
It follows a service-oriented architecture, with a set of independent services. 

The app has a variety of endpoints to support the full range of features found in an ecommerce platform,
including user authentication using JWT, payment processing using Stripe, guest carts for non-logged-in users,
and a shopping cart for registered users. 

It also support different user roles, including regular users and traders,
as well as administrative routes for managing the platform.

Work is still in progress.
